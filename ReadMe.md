### Ultra Modules for XAF
---

Ultra is a set of open source modules to extend the capabilites of the framework [XAF from developer express](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/application_framework/)

Ultra modules for XAF project is created José Manuel Ojeda Melgar, A.K.A [Joche Ojeda](https://www.jocheojeda.com).

Most of the ideas for these modules came
from endless conversations with technical peers, not all of them are mentioned here, but my appreciation and admiration goes for all of them:

- José Javier Columbie (Cuba/U.S.A) 
- Douglas Coto Lara (El Salvador)    Source Code
- Walter Omar Gavarrete (El Salvador)  [itwgsv](http://www.itwgsv.com)
- Pedro Hernández (Republica Dominicana) [People Works Services](http://www.peopleworksservices)
- Claudio Menetti (Italy) [informind.it](http://www.informind)

All Ultra modules are released under [Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MS-PL)

The philosophy of ultra modules is that a module should be easy obtain, install and setup so we have chosen nuget packages as our distribution method

### Nuget Version Numbers


Each nuget package has a version number as part of its identity. As such, two nugets that differ by version number are considered by the runtime to be completely different nuget packages. This version number is physically represented as a four-part string with the following format:

```<language>
<major version>.<minor version>.<build number>.<module version>
```

For example, version 18.2.4.1 indicates 18 as the major version, 2 as the minor version, 4 as the build number, and 1 as the version number of the ultra module.The first 3 numbers
represent the version of DevExpress nuget.
